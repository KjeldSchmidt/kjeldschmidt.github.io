Photobox for the wedding of my sister.

The box is assembled without glue, so that the sides can be wall-mounted permanently.
These side-panels came with hooks pre-installed for easy installation on the walls later.

The main body of the box is made from bamboo, the legs are made from Acacia scrap.
The images are laser-engraved, making them highly scratch-resistant.

At this point, I am still not entirely happy with my process for converting faces to laser-engravings.
While my process, consisting of isolating image components in Photoshop, then converting each component into
paths individually via Lightburn, works great on many things, it still frequently creates somewhat, frankly speaking, scary, faces.

The camera on the inside was WiFi-controlled, using an old phone as a preview and trigger.

According to my sister, the reveal of the box was the first time she couldn't stop herself from crying during her wedding weekend.

Mission Accomplished.

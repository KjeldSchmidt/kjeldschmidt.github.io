Today, I created the [unaver.org](https://kjeld-schmidt.com/unaver.org/) website as a spoof of
semantic versioning. There's not much to say about it - as you can see on the
linked page, Unary Semantic Versioning is the future of software versioning,
the ultimate solution. Enjoy reading.


**Update, 2024:** As I don't want to keep paying the domain cost for a silly joke, the page is now hosted under my personal domain for posterity.

I've written before about the [do-script](/posts/use-a-do-script/), but I didn't
exactly go into details about what makes it so powerful. I've used it as a
reference for myself dozens of times, but that could have been achieved with a 
Gist just as well.

So today, I want to explain properly how the task-file can play a central role
in high-quality repositories.

[^config-not-code]: A configuration thing, which all of our repository handle in a single file in the root directory. The dev in question made some config changes inline instead, even though they knew the established pattern.

[^reversible]: And all of these changes were easily reversible if any of us _had_ complained.

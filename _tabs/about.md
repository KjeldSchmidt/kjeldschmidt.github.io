I am a software developer, consultant, maker and curious learner.

At time of writing employed at [Thoughtworks](https://thoughtworks.com), living
in Cologne, Germany.

I often build small, quick, one-off projects. Some of the better ones end up
being mentioned here.

Occasionally, I will share thoughts about software development, insights
into technologies or repost content that I've produced for a different medium.
